# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification with Explainable AI

This project predicts movie genres from plot descriptions using Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and explains predictions using LIME.

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-label genre classification
- TF-IDF text features
- Logistic Regression & Deep Neural Network models
- Explainable AI with LIME
- Applied to large unlabeled movie dataset

## 📂 Dataset
- IMDb movie dataset with genres
- 50k movie dataset without genres (predicted)

## 🧠 Models
- One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression
- Deep Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras)

## 🔍 Explainability
LIME highlights keywords influencing genre predictions.

## 📊 Results
Model successfully predicts multiple genres and explains predictions on unseen movies.
